# Plugin Examples

[Request Rewrite plugins](https://mayhem4api.forallsecure.com/docs/rewrite.html) allow 
you to modify the requests generated by Mayhem for API before they are sent to your 
API Target.

These plugins are currently in pre-release.
The examples here may change as the feature evolves.

### [python-rewrite-plugin](python-rewrite-plugin)

This example implements the rewrite plugin service that changes the content-type from application/json to application/grpc-web-text, and base64 encodes the body.

### [java-rewrite-plugin](java-rewrite-plugin)

This example implements the same service as `python-auth-plugin` but written in Java.

### [rust-openid-token-plugin](rust-openid-token-plugin)

A plugin that injects an authorization header retreived from an
OAuth OpenID Connect access token endpoint, implemented in Rust.
This example implements the rewrite plugin adding an `Authorization` header to every request.

### [python-classify-plugin](python-classify-plugin)

This example implements the classify plugin by parsing the body for grpc-statuses and using them to create HTTP reponses.
